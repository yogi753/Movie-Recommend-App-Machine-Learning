# Movie-Recommend-app-Machine-Learning

1. A content based movie recommender system using cosine similarity*
   
2. Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

# Recommendation System Used

# Content-Based Approach 

1. Content-based systems, which use characteristic information and takes item attriubutes into consideration .
2. Twitter , Youtube .
3. Which music you are listening , what singer are you watching . Form embeddings for the features .
4. User specific actions or similar items reccomendation .
5. It will create a vector of it .
6. These systems make recommendations using a user's item and profile features. They hypothesize that if a user was interested in an item in the past, they will once again be interested in it in the future
7. One issue that arises is making obvious recommendations because of excessive specialization (user A is only interested in categories B, C, and D, and the system is not able to recommend items outside those categories, even though they could be interesting to them).

# About this project:

This is a streamlit web application that can recommend various kinds of similar movies based on an user interest. here is a Sample Snapshots of Demo,
